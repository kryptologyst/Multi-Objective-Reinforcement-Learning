# Project 280. Multi-objective reinforcement learning
# Description:
# In real-world applications, agents often face multiple conflicting objectives — like speed vs safety, performance vs energy use, or profit vs fairness. Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) trains agents to balance trade-offs between these goals.

# In this project, we simulate an agent that must complete a task quickly but is penalized for using too much power. The agent receives a vector reward with two components:

# Progress reward – for getting closer to the goal

# Energy penalty – for using high power actions

# The agent learns to optimize a weighted sum of these objectives using Q-learning.

# 🧪 Python Implementation (MORL with Weighted Rewards):

# ✅ What It Does:
# Agent moves toward a goal but must balance speed and energy use.

# Learns from a vector reward, reduced to a scalar via user-defined weights.

# Demonstrates reward trade-offs, which is essential in:

# Robotics (speed vs battery life)

# Finance (risk vs return)

# Healthcare (effectiveness vs cost)
